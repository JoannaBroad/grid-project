    <h2>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if
	not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s
	worth.

    <blockquote>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
	looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
	experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly
	fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
	grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully
	switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</blockquote>
