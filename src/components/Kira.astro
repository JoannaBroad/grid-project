			“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed
			some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step
			by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
			only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
			staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait
			long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
			outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
			tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
			interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped
			me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
			100% recommend! ”
